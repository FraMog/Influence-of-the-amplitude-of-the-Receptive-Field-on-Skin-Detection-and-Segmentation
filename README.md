# Influence-of-the-amplitude-of-the-Receptive-Field-on-Skin-Detection-and-Segmentation

Skin detection is the starting point for skin segmentation,that can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as face recognition, hand gesture analysis and naked people detection. Many papers on skin detection focus on algorithms that work on a single pixel: in this paper we investigate how the number of contiguous pixels analyzed at once can impact the performances of skin detection and segmentation.
